This can be anything from all the documents that are related to a specific _user_, or that were published after a certain _date_ and so on. Metadata filtering is very useful in these situations. In this tutorial, we will create a few simple documents containing information about Haystack, where the metadata includes information on what version of Haystack the information relates to. We will then do metadata filtering to make sure we are answering the question based only on information about Haystack 2.0.\n"
